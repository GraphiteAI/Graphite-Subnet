        """
        The priority function determines the order in which requests are handled. More valuable or higher-priority
        requests are processed before others. You should design your own priority mechanism with care.

        This implementation assigns priority to incoming requests based on the calling entity's stake in the metagraph.

        Args:
            synapse (template.protocol.Dummy): The synapse object that contains metadata about the incoming request.

        Returns:
            float: A priority score derived from the stake of the calling entity.

        Miners may recieve messages from multiple entities at once. This function determines which request should be
        processed first. Higher values indicate that the request should be processed first. Lower values indicate
        that the request should be processed later.

        Example priority logic:
        - A higher stake results in a higher priority value.
