## Setup üìã -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
We have a set of minimum hardware requirements for running a validator. See [min_compute.yml](../min_compute.yml).

_Compute requirements were estimated based on conservative projections of network traffic. Better/More computationally intensive algorithms are likely to benefit from faster compute._

<!-- <a id="clone-the-repository"></a>

### Clone the repository üìÇ
```bash
git clone #TODO replace with the actual repository link
cd graphite-ai-subnet
```

## Running a Miner üèÉ
To run a miner on the Graphite-AI subnet, miners will need to run the miner neuron. This neuron listens for incoming requests from validators and rewards are then given based on successful reponses to those requests.

```bash
python3 -m neurons.miner --netuid NETUID --subtensor.network NETWORK --wallet.name NAME --wallet.hotkey HOTKEY --logging.debug info --axon.port PORT --blacklist.force_validator_permit True
```
If you are running on a remote server, ensure that your internal and external ports are correct. If they differ, please add the --axon.external_port <EXTERNAL_PORT> flag.

using pm2:
```bash
pm2 start neurons/miner.py --name graphite_miner --interpreter python -- --netuid NETUID --subtensor.network NETWORK --wallet.name NAME --wallet.hotkey HOTKEY --logging.debug info --axon.port PORT --blacklist.force_validator_permit True
```

For more detailed instructions on creating a wallet and registering onto a subnet, refer to our [installation guide](./installation.md).

## Taotrader Miner Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your taotrader miner and understand the key metrics for success.

### Step 1: Create or Sign In to Your taotrader Account
Before you can start mining on taotrader, you'll need an account.
- Visit taotrader.xyz/signup to create a new account.
- If you already have an account, log in with your existing credentials.

![Step 1: Sign In Page](../static/yield/Step0SignInPage.png)

### Step 2: Choose Your Role: Leader
After logging in, you'll be taken to the "Choose Your Role" page.
- Select "Leader" as your role. This will direct you to the alias name and connected wallet confirmation screen.

![Step 2: Choose Role Page](../static/yield/Step1ChooseRolePage.png)

### Step 3: Confirm Your Alias and Wallet Connection
On this page, you'll see:
- The address of your connected wallet.
- Your assigned alias name.
- Click "Proceed" to go to the next step.

![Step 3: Wallet Connection](../static/yield/Step2Wallet.png)

### Step 4: Enter Your HotKey Address
- Enter your Subnet 43 Miner HotKey Address. This is the address you'll use for mining.
- Click "Check" to verify if the hotkey is already linked to another leader.
- If the hotkey is not in use, you'll see a success message saying it's "Hotkey is unbounded."

![Step 4: HotKey Check](../static/yield/Step3HotkeyCheck.png)

### Step 5: Check Your TAO Balance
- The system will check your balance.
- You need a minimum of 5œÑ and maximum of 15œÑ (free balance + staked balance on the cold key) to start mining.

![Step 5: Balance Check](../static/yield/Step4BalanceCheck.png)

### Step 6: Verify Your HotKey Ownership
- To prove you own the HotKey address, you need to sign a message.
- Enter the signature in the provided field.
- Click "Verify Signature."
- You should see a success message: "Signature verified successfully" and "All Requirements Met!"

![Step 6: Signature Check](../static/yield/Step5SignatureCheck.png)

### Step 7: Activate Your Leader Status
- Click "Proceed" to activate your leader status.
- Upon success, you will be taken to the last page of the setup.

![Step 7: Activate Leader](../static/yield/Step6ActivateLeader.png)

### Step 8: Confirmation: All Requirements Met
- This page confirms that your leader profile is set up.
- Click "Go to Mining Dashboard" to access your mining dashboard.

![Step 8: All Requirements Met](../static/yield/Step7AllRequirementsMet.png)

### Step 9: Understanding Your Leader Portfolio and Metrics
Your leader portfolio shows your mining activity. 

You'll be scored based on the following metrics which accounts for 20% of the total subnet rewards:
- **Historical Daily Profit and Losses (10%)**: This reflects the gains or losses from swapping your stake into different subnets. Higher profits improve your score.
- **Sharpe Ratio (55%)**: This measures risk-adjusted return. A higher Sharpe Ratio means you're getting more return for the risk you take. It's a measure of investment efficiency.
- **Volume Traded (10%)**: The total amount of TAO you've traded. Higher volume can indicate active and successful trading.
- **Notional Value of Copy Traders (5%)**: The total value of the portfolios of those who copy your trades. A higher value means more people are trusting your strategy.
- **Number of Copy Traders (10%)**: The more users copying you the better.
- **Max Drawdown (10%)**: The maximum percentage of loss from the peak to the trough of the portfolio. A lower max drawdown is better.

The organic portfolio rebalancing problem accounts for 20% of the total subnet rewards.

The last 60% of the total subnet rewards is allocated to the previous synthetic graph problems which remains the main focus of the subnet.
- TSP - 10%
- MTSP - 10%
- MDMTSP - 20%
- CMDMTSP/RCMDMTSP - 40%
- PORTFOLIO_REALLOCATION - 20%


### Important Points
- **Scoring**: Your score is calculated every hour.
- **Rebalancing**: After updating your portfolio, you have 300 blocks to make adjustments.
- **No-Trade Period**: There is a 6900 block no-trade period for leaders after updating your portfolio. This helps prevent scalping strategies. After this period, you can update your portfolio again.
- **Transfers**: You cannot transfer TAO in or out of this account at any time.

## Succeeding as a Miner for Graph problems üèÜ

Miners on the Graphite-AI subnet are tasked to solve graph optimization problems which have a myriad of real-world applications (refer to [subnet_overview.md](./subnet_overview.md) for more information.) Miners are rewarded based on their ability to produce good solutions within a given timeframe (default as 20 seconds).

We currently pose 2 types of graph problems: the Metric Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the General TSP. Various approaches to the problems have been researched. 

To perform well as a miner, you need to:
- Innovate more effective heuristics for solving large TSP problems 
- Implement existing algorithms in a computationally efficient manner
- Select the best approaches for solving each variant of the TSP across various graph sizes

<a id="provided-solvers"></a>

### Provided Solvers üß†

`Greedy Solver`:
This solver works by selecting the nearest neighbour as the next node to visit. The output path is rarely optimal but it is the simplest and fastest heuristic at $O(n^2)$ time complexity and $O(n)$ space complexity.

This is the default benchmark used by validators to determine the quality of your solution. As such, if you fail to beat this benchmark, your score will be penalized.

`Beam Search Solver`:
Beam search tracks the best n paths as it builds towards a complete path back to the origin node. Updating the beam width, $w$, can increase the likelihood of finding a better path but also increases the time and space complexity, $O(w \cdot n^2)$ and $O(w \cdot n)$ respectively.

`Dynamic Programming Solver`:
Dynamic programming is an approach that guarantees solution optimality. Through memoization, the time complexity is reduced from $O(n!)$ to $O(n^2 \cdot 2^n)$. However, this is still very computationally expensive where problems above 20 nodes take a significant amount of time to solve.

`Hybrid Pointer Network`:
Pointer networks are the most advanced AI approach for solving large TSP problems. It uses its attention mechanism to output a sequence of pointers.

### Improving the Stock Miner Code üõ†Ô∏è
Changes to the miner code can be made by changing the way that problems are assigned to different solvers. The solvers are implemented as classes that are instantiated along with the Miner. Simply edit the import statements and change the instantiated solver to your desired solver class.

A basic implementation is provided in the miner code. 

```python
# Conditional assignment of problems to each solver
if synapse.problem.n_nodes < 15:
    # Solves the problem to optimality but is very computationally intensive
    route = await self.solvers['small'].solve_problem(synapse.problem)
else:
    # Simple heuristic that does not guarantee optimality. 
    route = await self.solvers['large'].solve_problem(synapse.problem)
```

In the solvers module [graphite-ai/solvers], we provided 4 solvers: Greedy/NearestNeighbour, Beam Search, Dynamic Programming (DP), and Hybrid Pointer Network (HPN).

Rewards to miners are assigned based on their relative performance to the best answer of the cohort of solutions submitted by all the miners in the subnet. A performance filter is further applied by the validators that penalize answers that fall short of the performance benchmark which is set by the greedy solver.

As such, miners are encouraged to explore the various solvers and develop their own high-performance solvers that achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<a id="testing-suite"></a>

### Testing Suite üß™
As more miners compete on the subnet, miners will have to develop custom solvers by training better models or developing better algorithms. To aid in testing, we have also provided boilerplate code for evaluating the performance of your custom solver with the other stock solvers.

Edit the import statement and run the python file to get comparative metrics of the various solvers. You can also wrap the problem-to-solver assignment logic within a custom solver to compare various assignment strategies.

```python
from graphite_ai.solvers import *
.
.
.
test_solvers = [NearestNeighbourSolver(), BeamSearchSolver(), HPNSolver()] # add more solver instances
```
and run:
```bash
python tests/evaluate_solvers.py
```
You can expect such an output:
